# WebSynth Studio

WebSynth Studio is a browser-based analogue-style synthesizer built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and the Web Audio API. It runs fully offline, supports preset management, and now features configurable 2D expression control mapped to your device's trackpad.

- **Repository**: https://github.com/szabadkai/synth-demo
- **Live demo**: https://szabadkai.github.io/synth-demo (replace `szabadkai` with your GitHub username when deploying forks via GitHub Pages)

## Highlights

- **Dual oscillator engine** with sub, ring-mod, macro engines, and flexible mixer.
- **Filter, envelopes, and effects** including delay and convolution reverb.
- **Modulation system** with two assignable LFOs, arpeggiator, step sequencer, and macro controls.
- **Configurable XY expression**: engage CapsLock and glide on the trackpad to control any two parameters (filter cutoff, oscillator detune, FM amount, envelope times, macro sliders, LFO rate/depth, etc.).
- **Patch workflow**: import/export JSON patches, curate presets under `src/patches/`, and persist the working sound via local storage.
- **Responsive keyboard**: MIDI-like computer keyboard mapping, on-screen keys, pointer glissando, and octave shifts.

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed Vite URL (defaults to http://localhost:5173). Click the **Power On** button or press a key to resume audio. Use the on-screen keyboard, your computer keyboard (A/W/S/…), or CapsLock + trackpad to perform.

### Trackpad Expression Cheat Sheet

1. Toggle **CapsLock** to arm the XY surface.
2. Move your finger across the trackpad (or touch surface) to send X/Y values.
3. The live HUD shows which parameters are being modulated and their current percentage.
4. Customize X and Y destinations in the **Expression** panel.
5. Disengaging CapsLock smoothly restores each parameter to its stored patch value.

- React, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand
- Web Audio API with custom DSP voice engine
- Canvas oscilloscope visualization
- Vitest + React Testing Library for unit/UI tests

## Contributing

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Keep changes focused; follow conventional commits (e.g., `feat:` / `fix:`).
4. Ensure `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build` all pass before opening a PR.
5. Include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes.

## Deployment

- GitHub Pages serves the production bundle from `docs/`.
- To publish your fork, enable Pages (Project Sites) and set the source to `main` ➝ `/docs`. Update the README link to point at `https://<your-user>.github.io/synth-demo`.
